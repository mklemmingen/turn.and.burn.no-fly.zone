  classic machine-gun. 
    Wait till the opponent is close in front of you and appears bigger on screen. Do not try shooting while enemie is smaller than the aim rectile. No Arrow-UP/Arrow-Down-Adjustements needed. A simple left/right-swerve brings enemy into view.
    You need a good 4 seconds of hit-registering till the enemy plane is shoot down.
