In Mission 1, you are tasked with enforcing the no-fly-zone by shooting down a number of enemy MIG-planes.

You can either use your machine guide, or your Missiles. 

To try to finish fast, because you have only a limited amount of fuel, use the Map ("SELECT") to turn to the next enemy after finishing one off. 

Happy Hunting!
