### STARTING

  to start, wait till the decl crew signals that you are ready for take-off by waving with a stiff upper right arm. 

  Accelerate fully with "Arrow-Up + "B""

### LANDING

  Landing is the arguably hardest part of Turn and Burn. To stick it:

    - decellerate with "Arrow-Down + "B""
    - try to keep the aim recticle inbetween the two white stripes of the carrier deck to try being in the middle of them.
    - use the info deck to try and stay inbetween the horizontal and the displayed 45' line. This is meant to keep you from coming in at an angle of above 45', which would result in failure.

    you fail the landing because the plane was either:

      - above 45'
      - too fast
      - did not land on the deck inbetween the two white lines (even tho there is a good margin of error in this one)
